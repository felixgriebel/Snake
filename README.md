# Snake Game in Java


This is the famous snake game, writeen in Java.

To start the game run the .jar-file or compile the project by youself.


### How does it work?

To control your snake press:


   `W` to go up
   `A` to go left
   `S` to go down
   `D` to go right 


You can also change the them by pressing `L`.

There are 3 themes available which rotate.


You can pause the game with `ESC`. 
It is less fun when you pause it, but there is always a situation where you want to pause the game.

At the left-bottom corner is you apple counter, you should eat as many apples as possible.


To the apples:

   `red` is the default apple and you gain length after eating
   `orange` is a special apple and halfs the length of you snake
   `magenta` makes you go woooosh (you'll see)


If you die, the snake stops, the head starts blinking and the game resets after a few seconds.


To start the game, press a key.
